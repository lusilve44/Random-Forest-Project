# Random Forest and XGBoost Project

Here we implement the Random Forest algorithm for classification, applied to this dataset (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4GeeksAcademy/random-forest-project-tutorial/main/titanic_train.csv) and trying to predict the Survived value, our taget. Also we implement two methods for hyperparameters optimization, Grid Search and Randomized Search.
Later, we include in the work a boosting techinque called XGboost (decision-tree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework) for further optimization of the hyperparameters.
